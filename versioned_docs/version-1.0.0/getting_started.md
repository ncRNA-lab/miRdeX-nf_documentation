# Getting started

**miRdeX-nf** is a Nextflow-based pipeline for differential expression analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) from small RNA-seq data. One of its key features is the ability to process multiple comparisons, projects, or species within a single execution. Users can provide data from all projects of interest, and miRdeX-nf will independently process each dataset and generate the corresponding results in a single pipeline run.

## Workflow overview 

![Metromap light](./img/mirdex_metromap.svg#light-mode-only)
![Metromap dark](./img/mirdex_metromap_dark.svg#dark-mode-only)


1. SRA download (`prefetch` and `fasterq-dump`)
2. Support for direct input: FASTQ or precomputed count matrices
3. Read preprocessing (FASTQ):
   - Adapter and quality trimming (`fastp`)
   - Quality control (`FastQC`, `MultiQC`)
   - Filtering against user-provided reference FASTA (`Bowtie`)
   - Genome alignment with user-supplied genome (`Bowtie`)
4. Validation of sequencing depth for each library and minimum number of biological replicates per condition
5. Small RNA quantification:
   - Raw counts of small RNAs
   - Generation of raw count matrices
6. Exploratory and differential expression analysis:
   - Low-count filtering
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - `DESeq2`
7. miRNA annotation and isomiR classification:
   - Initial alignment of sRNA sequences to reference mature and precursor miRNAs from `miRBase`, `sRNAanno`, or `PmiREN` databases (`BLASTn`)
   - Classification of aligned sequences into:
     - Canonical miRNAs (perfect match to mature sequence)
     - Templated isomiRs (sequence variants that align perfectly with the precursor)
     - Non-templated isomiRs (variants with mismatches or additions not present in the precursor)
   - Realignment of non-templated sequences to the user-provided genome to discard perfect matches elsewhere (potential false positives) (`Bowtie`)
   - Abundance filtering based on minimum Reads Per Million (RPM) or relative abundance compared to the canonical miRNA:
     - Sequences passing the threshold are labeled as `PASS`
     - Sequences below threshold are labeled as `REJECT`
   - Final classification of detected isomiRs
   - Annotation of differentially expressed sRNAs to identify those corresponding to miRNAs or isomiRs
8. Global patterns of DE miRNAs
   - Generation of binary matrices indicating which miRNAs are differentially expressed across the analyzed conditions
   - Creation of log2FC matrices showing the direction and magnitude of expression changes
   - Summary provided at both individual miRNA and miRNA family levels
   - Designed to support global analysis and identification of shared or condition-specific expression patterns

This section guides you through **installation** and a minimal **first run** of miRdeX-nf.

## Installation

Before running **miRdeX-nf**, you need to install **Nextflow**, which is required to execute the workflow. Detailed installation instructions for Nextflow can be found here:

- [Nextflow installation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html)

In addition, you must have at least one supported execution environment installed: **Docker**, **Singularity**, or **Conda**. These environments provide the necessary containers or package management to run the pipeline reliably. Installation information for each is available at:

- [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- [Singularity installation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html)  
- [Conda installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

After installing the prerequisites, the pipeline can be obtained directly from GitHub. You can either **download a release archive** or **clone the repository** to get all workflow scripts and configuration files required to run **miRdeX-nf**:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/antoglz/miRdeX-nf.git
cd miRdeX-nf
```

## Usage

To run **miRdeX-nf**, you must provide a properly formatted samplesheet specifying the inputs and metadata for each analysis. The pipeline supports multiple input types, including FASTQ files, SRA accession lists, and raw count matrices. Only the FASTQ input format is shown below; for full details on all supported input types, see the usage documentation.

**samplesheet.csv**:

```csv
Id,File,Metadata,Genome,Group
sample1,data/sample1.fastq.gz,metadata/PROJECT1_meta.tsv genomes/ath.fa    
sample2,data/sample2.fastq.gz,metadata/PROJECT1_meta.tsv genomes/ath.fa    
sample3,data/sample3.fastq.gz,metadata/PROJECT1_meta.tsv genomes/ath.fa    
sample4,data/sample4.fastq.gz,metadata/PROJECT1_meta.tsv genomes/ath.fa    
sample5,data/sample5.fastq.gz,metadata/PROJECT1_meta.tsv genomes/ath.fa    
sample6,data/sample6.fastq.gz,metadata/PROJECT1_meta.tsv genomes/ath.fa    
```

In this example, each row represents a single-end FASTQ file associated with a sample to be analyzed. The columns represent:

- **Id**: FASTQ file identifier. It represents the sample ID and must match the Run column in the metadata file.
- **File**: Path to the input FASTQ file.
- **Metadata**: Path to a metadata file describing the experimental design (e.g., sample conditions, replicates).
- **Genome** *(optional)*: Path to a reference genome FASTA file. Required if genome-based filtering or isomiR annotation is enabled.
- **Group** *(optional)*: Used when input is a count matrix. Not required when using FASTQ files.

The pipeline can be executed as follows, specifying the input samplesheet, the output directory, and the execution environment (Docker, Singularity, or Conda):

```shell
nextflow run main.nf
   --input <SAMPLESHEET>
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../>
```

For full details on all pipeline features, supported input types, and configurable parameters, it is strongly recommended to consult the usage documentation and the parameter documentation before running the workflow.

:::info
Make sure to select an execution profile compatible with your system (`docker`, `singularity`, or `conda`). The profile determines how dependencies and containers are managed during workflow execution.

## Output

The pipeline produces a structured set of results, including processed libraries, quality control reports, quantification tables, differential expression results, and miRNA/isomiR annotations:
