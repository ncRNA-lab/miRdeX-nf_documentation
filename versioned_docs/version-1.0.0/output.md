## Data download
The data download stage retrieves raw sequencing data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using two utilities from the [SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools): **prefetch** and **fasterq-dump**.
Prefetch downloads the SRA run files (.sra) corresponding to accession numbers provided in the project metadata. It validates file integrity by checking checksums after transfer. Fasterq-dump then converts the downloaded .sra files into FASTQ format, supporting multi-threaded execution for improved performance. The output FASTQ files are compressed for storage efficiency and serve as the primary input for downstream quality control and preprocessing.

#### Output files

This step produces one compressed FASTQ file per sequencing library for single-end data.

File description:

- `*.fastq.gz` — Raw sequencing reads in standard FASTQ format, compressed with gzip. Each file contains all reads for a given library. These files are the direct input for the Quality Control (QC) step.


## Trimming

<div className="justified">
**Trimming** is the process of removing unwanted sequence elements and low-quality regions from raw sequencing reads. This includes the removal of adapter sequences introduced during library preparation, trimming of low-quality bases from read ends, and the exclusion of reads that fall below a defined minimum length. By eliminating these artifacts, trimming enhances both read quality and mapping performance in later stages of the pipeline.
</div>

### fastp

The trimming step is implemented using [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp), a high-performance, all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor written in C++ with full multithreading support. fastp automatically detects and removes adapter sequences, trims low-quality bases from the ends of reads, and discards any reads shorter than the user-defined minimum length (`--min_read_length`). This ensures that only high-quality reads are passed to downstream steps.

#### Output files

This step produces one compressed FASTQ file per library containing the adapter- and quality-trimmed reads that will be used in subsequent analyses.

## Quality control (QC)

The **quality control (QC)** stage evaluates sequencing read quality both before and after trimming. QC is performed with FastQC for per-library assessments and MultiQC for aggregated project-level summaries.

### FastQC
The quality assessment of **individual libraries** is performed using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). FastQC runs a series of diagnostic checks on raw and trimmed reads, including per-base sequence quality, GC content, sequence length distribution, overrepresented sequences, and adapter contamination. Running FastQC on both pre- and post-trimmed datasets allows direct comparison to verify sequencing quality and to assess the effectiveness of the trimming process.

#### Output files
This step produces one HTML report and one compressed archive per library, both containing the results of all FastQC quality metrics.

### MultiQC

[MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) compiles all individual FastQC reports into a single aggregated HTML report. This global summary provides an at-a-glance overview of sequencing quality across all libraries, enabling rapid detection of systematic issues, batch effects, or quality trends that might affect downstream analyses.

#### Output files

MultiQC generates one interactive HTML report at the **project level**.

## Validation

The **validation** stage verifies that datasets meet minimum quality and replication standards before proceeding to Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). This step ensures that downstream statistical analyses are based on sufficiently deep and adequately replicated datasets. Two distinct validation modes are implemented depending on the input type: **Library validation** and **Count matrix validation**. In both modes, validation operates at the analysis group level, ensuring that all sample groups to be compared in DEA satisfy the thresholds specified by the user.

### Library validation (*Option 1*)

The **library validation** step evaluates the suitability of both individual libraries and their corresponding analysis groups for inclusion in downstream analyses. Two independent criteria are applied: the **sequencing depth** of each library and the **minimum number of biological replicates** per sample group within an analysis group. These thresholds are defined by the user via the `--validation_depth` and `--validation_rep` parameters, respectively.

Validation ensures that only analysis groups meeting both criteria — sufficient sequencing depth in all relevant libraries and adequate replication in all compared sample groups — are carried forward into DEA.

#### Output files
This step produces two tab-delimited reports — one detailing library-level validation (depth and replicates) and another summarizing analysis group validity based on these criteria. Libraries or groups failing validation are excluded from subsequent steps.

  - `Number_valid_files` — Number of libraries passing both depth and replicate requirements.
  - `Number_not_valid_files` — Number of libraries failing one or both requirements.

```

### Count matrix validation (*Option 2*)

The **count matrix validation** step is applied when the input provided in the samplesheet is a precomputed count matrix for a specific analysis group (`--from_counts`) rather than raw sequencing libraries. In this scenario, sequencing depth is not applicable, and validation instead considers two main aspects. First, the **structural integrity** of the matrix is checked to ensure that the file follows the expected format, including correct column names and appropriate data types. Second, the **number of biological replicates** in each sample group intended for DEA is verified against the user-defined threshold (`--validation_rep`). An analysis group passes validation only if the matrix structure is correct and all sample groups satisfy the replicate requirement, and any group failing either criterion is excluded from DEA.


#### Output files
This step produces two tab-delimited reports — one detailing library-level validation (depth and replicates) and another summarizing analysis group validity based on these criteria. Libraries or groups failing validation are excluded from subsequent steps.

```

## Filtering

The **filtering** stage aims to remove undesired sequences and retain only those relevant for downstream analysis, using [Bowtie](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml) — an ultrafast, memory-efficient short-read aligner that leverages the Burrows–Wheeler index to minimize memory usage while maintaining high mapping speed. In miRdeX-nf, Bowtie runs in single-end mode and supports full multi-threading, enabling the rapid alignment of millions of small RNA reads. This step can be applied in two modes: **Database** and **Genome** filtering.

Both modes produce, for each library, an alignment summary file along with compressed FASTQ files containing reads classified as either aligned (retained or discarded, depending on the mode) or unaligned. Additional Bowtie parameters can be passed using `--bowtie_filt_db_ext_args` or `--bowtie_filt_genome_ext_args`.


### Database filtering

In this mode, reads are aligned against a user-defined reference sequence **database** specified with `--filt_db /path/to/database.fasta`. The database typically contains unwanted sequences such as rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, etc. Reads mapping to this database are discarded, and only the unaligned reads are passed to downstream analysis. Additional alignment parameters for Bowtie can be provided via `--bowtie_filt_db_ext_args`.

#### Output files

This *optional* step generates, for each library, an alignment report and two FASTQ files containing reads classified as **aligned** (discarded) or **unaligned** (retained for further analysis).

### Genome filtering

In this mode, reads are aligned to the reference **genome** specified in the Genome column of the samplesheet when `--filt_genome` is enabled. Reads mapping to the genome are retained, while unaligned reads are discarded, ensuring that only sequences originating from the target species proceed to downstream steps. Additional Bowtie parameters can be provided via `--bowtie_filt_genome_ext_args`.

#### Output files
This *optional* step produces an alignment summary and two FASTQ files per library, containing reads classified as **aligned** (retained) or **unaligned** (discarded).

## Quantification

The quantification step measures the abundance of each unique small RNA sequence detected in the dataset and structures this information for downstream Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). It produces two main outputs: **per-library read counts**, which provide absolute or normalized counts for each sequence in individual libraries, and **analysis group-specific count matrices**, which combine counts from multiple samples belonging to the same analysis group.

### Per-library sequence quantification

For each library, the pipeline quantifies the **abundance of every unique sequence** present in the preprocessed reads. This is achieved by counting the number of times each sequence occurs, producing raw counts that represent the absolute sequencing depth for that sequence within the library. Optionally, counts can be expressed as **Reads Per Million (RPM)**, where counts are scaled by the total number of reads in the library. Raw counts are always generated for downstream DEA, while RPM values are only produced if explicitly requested.

#### Output files

This step produces **one file per library** containing the abundance values for every detected sequence.

TGACAGAAGAGAGTGAGCAC	118076.98
TGAAGCTGCCAGCATGATCTA	80845.67
...
```

### Count matrix construction

For each **analysis group** defined in the metadata file (`Group` column), the pipeline merges the counts from all libraries belonging to that group into a single matrix. An analysis group represents a set of samples analyzed together in a single DEA, typically containing at least two distinct experimental conditions (e.g., Control vs Treatment, Wild-type vs Mutant).

This grouping strategy enables the pipeline to handle multi-project or multi-condition datasets efficiently, generating separate matrices for each group and ensuring that comparisons are performed only between biologically relevant samples. Raw count matrices are required for DEA, while RPM matrices are optional and intended for visualization or exploratory analyses outside DEA.

#### Output files

This step produces **one matrix per analysis group**, with either absolute counts or RPM-normalized counts for all samples in that group. Each matrix is a tab-delimited file where rows correspond to unique sequences and columns correspond to individual samples within the analysis group.

### Samplesheet generation (*optional*)

In addition to the count matrices, the pipeline can optionally generate a **samplesheet at the quantification stage**. This file follows the same format as the standard pipeline input samplesheet and contains metadata entries for each analysis group, along with the file paths to the corresponding **raw count matrices**.
This functionality is designed to allow the workflow to be resumed directly from the quantification stage in a future run, without repeating earlier steps such as data download, trimming, filtering, or quality control. It is particularly useful when the first part of the pipeline is executed separately—e.g., to preprocess and quantify sequencing data—while deferring DEA and annotation to a later execution.

#### Output files

One samplesheet file is generated per project, located under 05-Quantification/03-Samplesheet/.

## Differential expression analysis (DEA)

Differential expression analysis (DEA) is performed with [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html), a statistical framework that models count data using negative binomial distributions, estimates size factors and dispersion parameters, and applies shrinkage methods to improve log2 fold-change (log2FC) estimation. For each analysis group defined in the metadata (`Group` column), the pipeline performs two main stages: **Exploratory Analysis** and **Statistical Testing**.

### Exploratory analysis (EA)

The exploratory analysis phase provides an initial assessment of the dataset before formal statistical testing. Its primary goals are to identify potential outliers, evaluate variance patterns, and determine whether samples cluster according to their biological conditions. This early insight is crucial for detecting technical artifacts, batch effects, or weak separation between experimental groups, allowing users to make informed decisions about data quality and downstream analysis.

#### Output files

For each analysis group, the pipeline generates a set of exploratory visualizations and summary tables that describe variance structure and sample relationships. These include mean–variance plots (raw and VST-transformed data), interactive and static PCA plots, and an optional clustering significance test.

File description:
- **Mean–variance plot** — Before performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the pipeline automatically computes the relationship between mean abundance and variance across features, both on raw counts and on counts transformed using the **Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST)**. This transformation, applied exclusively for exploratory purposes, stabilizes variance across the dynamic range of counts, preventing highly abundant sequences from dominating the analysis. The VST-transformed data are then used as input for PCA.

![Mean vs Var](./img/mean_vs_var.png)

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** — A dimensionality-reduction technique that projects high-dimensional expression data onto a small number of orthogonal axes (principal components) that explain most of the variance in the dataset. In this context, PCA helps to:
  - Identify whether samples cluster according to their experimental conditions.
  - Detect batch effects or outlier samples.
  
  *Clustering test (Optional)*: After computing the PCA, the coordinates of each sample on the first three principal components are used to calculate pairwise Euclidean distances between samples. Two sets of distances are then compared:
    - **Intra-condition distances** – distances between samples belonging to the same experimental condition (e.g., control vs control).
    - **Inter-condition distances** – distances between samples from different experimental conditions (e.g., control vs treated).
  
  A **Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) test** is applied to assess whether intra-condition distances are significantly smaller than inter-condition distances, which would indicate that samples cluster more tightly within their respective conditions than between them. The significance threshold for this test is defined via `--ea_p_value`. Groups failing this test (p-value above threshold) may indicate weak separation between conditions, potentially due to biological similarity, low statistical power, or technical artifacts. **Such information can be used to decide whether a given analysis group should be retained for downstream steps**.

  Three PCA outputs are generated:
  - `*.ea.html` — An interactive 3D **PCA plot** (Plotly) for dynamic inspection.
  
  ![pca](./img/pca.png)

  - `*variance.ea.png` — A **variance bar plot** showing the percentage of total variance explained by each component.
  
  ![pca variance](./img/pca_variance.png)
  
  - `*.ea_summary.tsv` — **Summary** statistics from the EA stage, including proportion of variance explained by the top principal components and the p-value from the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test (Clustering test). Example:

```

### DESeq2

The statistical testing phase uses DESeq2 to identify sequences with significant differences in expression between experimental conditions within each analysis group. Two statistical testing methods are supported:
- **Wald test (default)** – Evaluates whether the estimated log2FC between two conditions differs significantly from zero (or from a user-defined threshold if `--log2FC_threshold` is set).
- **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)** – Compares a full model to a reduced (nested) model, useful for detecting features with any change across multiple conditions.
  
**Significance** is determined using two user-configurable thresholds:

- **Alpha** — Controlled via the `--dea_alpha` (default: `0.05`) option. This parameter not only defines the statistical significance cut-off but is also used by DESeq2 to optimize independent filtering (default in DESeq2: 0.1).
- **log2FC threshold** — Defined by the `--log2FC_threshold` (default: `0`) option. This threshold modifies the null hypothesis of the Wald test from **“log2FC equals zero” to “absolute log2FC equals the specified threshold”**, making the test more conservative than post-hoc filtering and typically yielding fewer significant sequences. When this threshold is set, Wald tests are used and any LRT p-values are replaced accordingly.
  
Both thresholds are applied directly within DESeq2’s `results()` function, ensuring that statistical significance and effect size filtering are integrated into the statistical testing itself rather than applied as a separate downstream filter.

#### Output files

For each analysis group, DESeq2 produces a complete set of statistical results summarizing the expression changes for every tested sequence. These results are saved in two complementary tables: one containing the full output of the statistical testing, and another containing only the sequences that meet the significance criteria defined by the user.

## miRNA/isomiR annotation

In this stage, **canonical microRNAs (miRNAs) and potential isomiRs are identified** from the processed sequencing libraries, after trimming and optional filtering. The process combines sequence similarity searches against curated miRNA reference databases with a subsequent classification and filtering workflow, allowing the distinction between true miRNA variants and sequencing artifacts.

### Reference alignment (BLASTn)

The annotation step begins by aligning sRNA sequences against reference mature and precursor miRNAs from [miRBase](https://mirbase.org), sRNAanno, or [PmiREN](https://www.prmiren.com) using [BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/). BLAST is a widely used sequence comparison algorithm that detects regions of local similarity between sequences and reports detailed alignment metrics, including identity percentage, alignment length, e-value, and bit score. These results enable the precise identification of sequences matching known miRNAs, either partially or in full.

#### Output files

The BLAST alignment step produces a set of output files containing detailed match information for each queried small RNA sequence against mature and precursor miRNA reference databases. Separate result files are generated for alignments to mature sequences, precursor sequences, and a combined table integrating both. Each file includes the query sequence identifier, matched reference ID(s), alignment statistics (identity, alignment length, mismatches, gaps, start/end positions), and standard BLAST metrics such as e-value and bit score. These outputs serve as the foundation for the downstream miRNA/isomiR classification and filtering stages.

### IsomiR filtering and classification

Following the BLAST alignment stage, candidate sequences undergo a refinement and categorization process to distinguish true biological miRNA variants from sequencing artifacts or unrelated small RNAs. This step is essential for ensuring that downstream analyses focus on high-confidence annotations, accurately separating canonical miRNAs from the diverse spectrum of isomiRs.

- **Canonical miRNAs** – sequences with perfect identity to a known mature miRNA.
- **IsomiRs** – variants of canonical miRNAs with sequence differences. IsomiRs are further subtyped:
   - iso_5p:+/-N — Shift in the 5′ end of the sequence.
   - iso_3p:+/-N — Shift in the 3′ end of the sequence.
   - iso_add5p:N — Non-templated nucleotide additions at the 5′ end.
   - iso_add3p:N — Non-templated nucleotide additions at the 3′ end.
   - iso_snv_seed — Substitutions in positions 2–7 (seed region).
   - iso_snv_central — Substitutions in positions 9–12.
   - iso_snv_central_offset — Substitutions in position 8.
   - iso_snv_central_supp — Substitutions in positions 13–17.
   - iso_snv — Substitutions outside the regions above.

All sequences annotated as isomiRs undergo a dedicated filtering stage to ensure that only biologically meaningful variants are retained.
This process consists of two main steps:

- **Genomic alignment for non-templated isomiRs** – Non-templated isomiRs—those whose sequence does not perfectly match the canonical miRNA nor its precursor—are aligned to the organism’s reference genome (via Bowtie). This step identifies and discards variants that may originate from unrelated genomic loci rather than from the annotated miRNA precursor.

- **Abundance filtering (all isomiRs)** – IsomiRs are evaluated for expression level to exclude low-confidence variants likely arising from sequencing noise. The pipeline supports two filtering strategies:
  - **RPM** – Minimum Reads Per Million.
  - **Relative abundance** – Ratio between the RPM of the isomiR and the RPM of its canonical miRNA within the same sample.
  
These thresholds must be met in a minimum number of samples, ensuring that retained isomiRs have consistent and reproducible expression patterns.

#### Output files

This stage produces structured annotation files describing all identified canonical miRNAs and isomiRs for each sample. These annotations include the positions of each sequence relative to its precursor miRNA, the relationship to the canonical miRNA, variant classification, sequence details, and basic expression metrics.

### DEA results annotation

This step refines the output of the **differential expression analysis (DEA)** by retaining only those sequences that have been annotated as **canonical miRNAs** or **isomiRs**. It integrates the statistical results from DESeq2 with the detailed annotation metadata, producing enriched result tables that combine expression changes, statistical significance, and biological context. By consolidating DEA and annotation information, this stage facilitates the interpretation of expression patterns in terms of specific miRNAs, isomiR variants, and miRNA families, enabling more targeted biological conclusions.

#### Output files

The files generated in this step combine DEA statistical metrics with annotation details from previous stages, but include **only significantly differentially expressed sequences** annotated as miRNAs or isomiRs. Two main result tables are produced: one containing all matching annotations (including possible multiple matches per sequence) and another with collapsed entries for unique sequences. Additional outputs provide graphical summaries and per-family consistency reports.

## Global patterns of DE miRNAs

This step produces global summary matrices that provide an **overview of miRNA family behavior across all analysis groups**. It condenses the results from differential expression analyses into presence/absence and representative effect-size matrices, enabling downstream analysis, pattern discovery, and cross-comparison between experiments.

#### Output files

This step generates two main summary matrices. The first is a **binary presence/absence matrix**, which indicates whether each miRNA family has at least one significantly differentially expressed member in each analysis group. The second is an **effect-size matrix**, which reports the shrunken log2FC of the most representative family member (the one with the highest `baseMean`) in each analysis group. In addition to these matrices, two auxiliary files are produced to map the encoded analysis group identifiers to their corresponding metadata values, allowing straightforward interpretation of the matrix column names.

File description:

- `miRNA_fam_presence_absence_table.tsv` — **Binary matrix** where rows correspond to miRNA families and columns correspond to encoded analysis group identifiers. A cell contains 1 if at least one member of the miRNA family is significantly differentially expressed in that analysis group, or 0 if no members meet the criteria. The **column names** are unique analysis group identifiers generated from the metadata fields specified by the user with the `--global_fields` argument (e.g., Species,Treatment,Level,Time,Cultivar,Tissue,Stage,Genotype). Each identifier consists of numeric tokens separated by dots, where the position of each number corresponds to a specific metadata field (in the order provided by the user) and the value of the number indicates the assigned code for the level of that field (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana = 1, Glycine max = 2). The mapping between identifiers and their full metadata descriptions can be found in `comparisons_ids.tsv`, while the mapping of numeric codes to field values is in `ids.tsv`.

```plaintext
miRNA_fam	1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1	1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1	2.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1
miR156	1	0	1
miR157	0	1	1
miR164	1	1	0
```

- `miRNA_fam_shrunken_log2FC_table.tsv` — **Effect-size matrix** where rows correspond to miRNA families and columns correspond to the same encoded analysis group identifiers described above. Each cell contains the **shrunken log2FC** (DESeq2) of the most representative member of the family — defined as the significantly differentially expressed member with the highest baseMean in that analysis group. If no members are significantly DE in a group, the cell is NA.
The interpretation of column identifiers follows the same encoding and mapping rules as for `miRNA_fam_presence_absence_table.tsv`, with details available in `comparisons_ids.tsv` and `ids.tsv`.
  
```plaintext
miRNA_fam	1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1	1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1	2.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1
miR156	0.85	NA	-1.24
miR157	NA	1.12	0.67
miR164	-0.54	0.92	NA
```

- `comparisons_ids.tsv` — Mapping table that links each encoded **analysis group identifier** (`Id`) to a second, project-based analysis group identifier (Comparison_id), which is constructed by combining the project identifier (`Project` column in the metadata) with the analysis group label (`Group` column in the metadata). The table also contains the set of metadata fields specified by the user in `--global_fields` (e.g., Species, Treatment, Level, Time, Cultivar, Tissue, Stage, Genotype), with each column showing the value of that field for the corresponding analysis group. The `Id` is generated by concatenating numeric codes assigned to the levels of these selected metadata fields, preserving the exact order in which they were provided by the user.

```plaintext
Comparison_id	Id	Species	Treatment	Level	Time	Cultivar	Tissue	Stage	Genotype
PRJNA000001_1	1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1	Arabidopsis thaliana	Heat	37°C	24h	Col-0	Leaves	Seedling	G.0

PRJNA000002_1	2.1.1.2.2.2.2.1	Oryza sativa	Heat	37°C 48h	Nipponbare	Root	Vegetative	G.0
```
- `ids.tsv` — Master dictionary mapping each numeric code used in the encoded identifiers (`Id`) to its corresponding metadata value (`Name`) and category (`Type`). This file is used to decode the numeric tokens that make up the column names of the matrices.

## Workflow report

The **workflow reporting** step consolidates information from both Nextflow’s native execution reports and pipeline-specific summary files, enabling reproducibility, traceability, and post-run diagnostics. These outputs provide an overview of the pipeline execution, including computational resource usage, software versions, parameter settings, and key biological metrics derived from the analysis.
Nextflow’s built-in reports focus on execution metadata (e.g., process runtimes, memory usage, job dependencies), while the pipeline adds an additional summary table (`mirdex_summary_<TIMESTAMP>.tsv`) to track biological and analytical results for each library and analysis group. Together, these outputs provide a complete audit trail of both computational and analytical aspects of the run.
